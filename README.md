Microwave Simulator: An Interactive Python Application
Welcome to the GitHub repository for the Microwave Simulator, an engaging and educational Python application designed to mimic the functionality of a real-world microwave. This application utilizes tkinter for the graphical user interface (GUI) and pygame for audio feedback, providing a realistic experience of operating a microwave through a desktop application. Ideal for educational purposes, UI/UX design experiments, or simply for entertainment, the Microwave Simulator offers a unique way to explore the principles of GUI development and event handling in Python.

Key Features:
Realistic Microwave Interface: A digital display and button layout akin to an actual microwave, allowing users to input cooking time and start the microwave.
Audio Feedback: Utilizes pygame to play sound effects for button presses and the microwave's timer completion, enhancing the realism of the simulation.
Multithreading for Timer: Implements Python's threading to manage the countdown timer concurrently with the main application, ensuring the GUI remains responsive.
Dynamic Display Updates: The digital display updates in real-time, showing the countdown timer and completion status, mirroring the feedback expected from a physical microwave.
Clear and Enter Functions: Includes functional "Clear" and "Enter" buttons for user input correction and confirmation, respectively, further mimicking microwave operations.
How It Works:
User Input: Utilize the numerical buttons to enter the desired cooking time on the digital display.
Start the Microwave: Press the "Enter" button to start the countdown timer based on the entered time.
Audio Feedback: Hear realistic sound effects for button presses and the end of the cooking cycle.
Watch the Countdown: The display shows the remaining time, counting down to zero.
Completion Alert: Upon reaching zero, a completion sound plays, and the display indicates that the cooking cycle is done.
